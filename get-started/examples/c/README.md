# Python Example

This is a very simple example snake written in Python.
It outputs a random move each turn, while completely ignoring the game state.

It does not follow good coding practices, and you should rewrite it entirely.
It does, however, allow a debugger to attach, allowing you to use breakpoints in your code.
Make sure to set `wait: true` in the config file.

Run it (from this root directory) using `./snakes[.exe] --config ./snakes/config.yaml`.
Make sure you have saved the game files (`snakes[.exe]` and `assets/`) in the `snakes/` folder.
