# Java Example

This is a very simple example snake written in Java.
It outputs a random move each turn, while completely ignoring the game state.

It does not follow good coding practices, and you should rewrite it entirely.
Make sure the config file has the correct path to your packaged jar file.

Run it (from this root directory) using `./snakes[.exe] --config ./snakes/config.yaml`.
Make sure you have saved the game files (`snakes[.exe]` and `assets/`) in the `snakes/` folder.
