# Tips and Tricks

1. Make sure to set a seed in the config file so you can reproduce games.
2. Consider finding a few seeds with interesting scenarios and cycling between them to test a variety of situations.
3. Play against previous versions of your snake to see if you have improved, and where you broke things.
4. Just because you won one game, doesn't mean you will win every game. Make sure to test a few games with different seeds!
5. The [A* Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) is a great way to find the shortest path between two points.
6. Write clean code! It is easier to debug and fix clean code than it is to fix a collection of hacks tied together with duct tape.
7. Use structures available in your chosen language (such as objects and structs) to make sure you write the best code possible.
8. You can set the `wait` config option to `true` with a `timeout` of `0` to play the game at the fastest speed that all snakes can operate at.
9. Play against other people's snakes, you never know what interesting strategies you might be able to discover!
10. Have fun! This is a game for learning, not a life or death competition.
